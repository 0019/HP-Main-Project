IMPLEMENTATION I

One projector, one pc.
Showcase mode: picture by picture. Picture by picture mode is more efficient - no need to walk across the whole setting.
Therefore, It's more suitable for this conference style demonstration.


ABOUT THIS DRAFT

One world, four telepoint, corresponding to four 360 pictures. 
This will be able to demonstrate the basic ability of switching between different scenes, which is the essence of this implementation.
